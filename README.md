# Unity Scene Switcher
A nifty tool that allows you to quickly switch between scenes in the Unity Editor!

> This tool requires the [unity-toolbar-extender](https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender) package! <br><br>
> It is already included in the <code>.unitypackage</code> file, but make sure you don't have two copies of <code>ToolbarExtender.Editor.asmdef</code> in your project!

## How to install:

Just download the <code>.unitypackage</code> file, run it and press <code>Import</code>!

This means you have two copies of <code>ToolbarExtender.Editor.asmdef</code> in your project, locate one of them and delete it.
